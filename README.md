# Minerals Frozen

Adds dynamic ice and snow formations that can be used for building walls and cooling rooms.

- Deep snow banks spawn and grow when it snows, and melt with temperatures are above freezing
- Icicles spawn and grow near the edges of roofs and under natural roofs when the temperature is near freezing
- Snow and ice formations can be mined for snow and ice blocks that can be used for building walls and cooling rooms as they melt
- Snow and ice walls provide a way to quickly build structures without wood but melt when above above freezing 

See other mods in the "Minerals" collection to get the full experience:

- **Minerals Rock**: Complete overhaul of mountains and rocks
- **Minerals Sparkle**: Valuable crystals that can be mined for gems in remote and extreme biomes

The Minerals mods are still being balanced. Feel free to let me know if anything needs to be adjusted!

I am not aware of any incompatibilities with other mods, but please let me know if you find any.

Requires "Minerals Framework" to function.
